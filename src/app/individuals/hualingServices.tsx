Our network of professional haulers will help you load and deliver your items to a dump or recycling center. Please contact your local recycling center in advance to find out their recycling costs and their hours of operations before scheduling your Parcel-King pickup. The appliance recycling costs from the recycling center are separate from Parcel King pickup and delivery fee. The delivery professional will charge the recycling fees to their own credit card and then add the charges to your final bill."
