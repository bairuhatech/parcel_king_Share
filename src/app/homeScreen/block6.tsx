The driver took very good care of the furniture, using blankets and tie downs. The driver also helped move it into my house, and wow was it heavy. The driver went above and beyond, I couldn't be more pleased with this app. Thanks for running a great service.",

The individuals were very professional and punctual. The ParcelKing platform was simple and straight forward and I got response within minutes of submitting move request. I would recommend anyone looking to do moves or pickup to use their services. In fact while at Costco many people enquires about how and what I am using to move. The plus was that the platform allows you to add a helper to your request. Happy Moving",

If you are in need of a quick, super easy and convenient delivery company ParcelKing is your company. I'm from Atlanta, GA I did try reaching out to other companies before this with no response. ParcelKing allowed me to do everything straight from the app, including track my package. Thank You ParcelKing.",
